# Groupby: Given a key column, one can partition a table into groups:

# Aggregate
#
# We can aggregate a column over the groups using an aggregate function.
#    * Built-in functions include 'sum' 'mean' 'median' 'mode' 'count' 'std' 'nunique'.
#    * Can also pass an arbitrary function whose argument is a vector and returns a scalar.

# Multiple Group By
# To get a series for each community area we could just loop over them.
# But there is a better way.
# Group by can take *multiple* keys, in this case community area and day.
# The result has a (row) *multi-index*.
crimes_by_community_day = crimes.groupby(['Community Area', 'Day'])
crimes_by_community_day_count = crimes_by_community_day['ID'].agg('count')

# Similarly for arrests, then we can take their quotient:

# How can we plot multiple of these time series together? Unstacking

# There are missing values after reshaping.
# That means there were no crimes in that area on that day so `fillna(0)`

# Join
# What if we want to know the crime rate in the community for each housing development?
# We can find this using what's called a join or merge.
# First let's turn the community_crime_count Series into a DataFrame:
community_area_crime = pd.DataFrame({'Crime Count': community_crime_count})
community_area_crime

housing_crime = housing.merge(community_area_crime,
                              left_on='Community Area Number', right_index=True)
housing_crime

# Another aggregate
# We can pass other functions to aggregate:
community_housing = pd.DataFrame({
                                'Affordable Housing Units': housing.groupby(
                                'Community Area Number')['Units'].agg('sum')
                                })
community_housing
housing_crime_aggregate = community_housing.join(community_area_crime)
housing_crime_aggregate.shape
# Join types
# Why does the above join only have entries for 53 community areas? <br>
# Because `merge` defaults to a `left` join. There are four types of joins:
# - left (left is master), use only keys from left frame (SQL: left outer join)
# - right (right is master), use only keys from right frame (SQL: right outer join)
# - inner (DEFAULT), use intersection of keys from both frames (SQL: inner join)
# - outer , use union of keys from both frames (SQL: full outer join)

# In this case we want an `outer` join.
housing_crime_aggregate = community_housing.merge(
        community_area_crime, left_index=True, right_index=True, how='outer')
housing_crime_aggregate.shape
housing_crime_aggregate

# Rows without a corresponding row in the merge are filled with missing values.
# In our case those should be zeros, so we can `fillna(0)`.
housing_crime_aggregate.fillna(0, inplace=True)
housing_crime_aggregate.plot(kind='scatter', x='Affordable Housing Units', y='Crime Count')
