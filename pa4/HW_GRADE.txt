-10 on part d: I believe because you didnâ€™t quite clean up the origins enough 
so it threw the results off. Otherwise great work! Your approach is very good from an OOP 
and raw programming standpoint, so even though you didn't make as much use of the built-in
tools (which would honestly make things a lot easier) you should will probably do very well
understanding things future classes or projects may throw at you.

+20 for part A.

Overall 110/100
